# Guide and Tips for Research Fellows at Northwestern Kellogg


# Taking part in classes and seminars
## Classes
There are two ways you can take a class at Northwestern:
1. You can **audit** a class by emailing a professor before the start of the quarter, and defining what the requirements will be. Most professors require you to do all the readings, some do not want you handing in assignments since this implies a larger workload for them or their TAs. You can only audit MBA and PhD courses. Here is a list of all available courses:
    1. Kellogg MBA courses: https://www6.kellogg.northwestern.edu/CourseCatalog
    2. Kellogg PhD courses: https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/doctoral/academicexperience/phd-courses.aspx
    3. Department of Economics PhD courses: https://economics.northwestern.edu/graduate/courses/index.html
2. You can **enroll** in [undergraduate-level courses](https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/courses-az/)
## Seminars
There are several seminars and lunches you can sign up to attend. You can look for your fields of interest in the following lists (which overlap):
1. Seminars organized by the Department of Economics: https://economics.northwestern.edu/events/seminars/index.html
2. Faculty and research events at Kellogg: https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/events.aspx
3. Global Poverty Research Lab events: https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/global-poverty-research-lab/events.aspx
