# Tips for Research Fellows at Northwestern Kellogg
Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/clandinq/fellow_guide/issues) if you have any suggestions or corrections for this guide!

## A very short guide to the Kellogg Global Hub
- You need your wildcard to unlock the building's main doors, the elevator, and department doors after 5 PM during weekdays and at all times during weekends.
- You can park your bike in the lower level underground parking garage. There is a small square in front of the easternmost garage door, and this activates the sensor that opens the door up. The left door leads to the elevator closest to the gym and the 200/300 wings, the right door leads to the elevator closest to the 100/400 wings.
- The reflection rooms in the fifth floor are great places for quiet study and reading.
- There is free coffee all mornings in the Faculty Summit. There is also a coffee machine in the Strategy department pantry (4200). Bring your own mug to reduce waste.
- The gym is open Mon-Fri 7am-6pm. After 12pm, ask someone at the front desk to open gym, since there is no attendant at the gym after noon and your wildcard will not open it.
- You can buy lunch at Gordon's Marketplace, but there is also a small coffee shop in the lower level (next to KIS). Other options are:
    - [Multiple dining options at Norris](https://www.northwestern.edu/norris/services/dining.html), including Starbucks, Viet Nom Nom, Mod Pizza and Dunkin’ Donuts
    - [Cafe Coralie](https://goo.gl/maps/C8j8AUrA8rWrGx3i9) at the Life Science Pavilion
    - [Cheap lunch](https://www.nugcf.org/cheap-lunch) at the Sheil Catholic Center: $2 meals during the academic year
- Join the [Kellogg MBA Slack channel](kellogg-mba.slack.com) to gain access to useful channels (marketplace, free food) and find out about extracurricular activities that might interest you, from social events to group bike rides. If you can't access by clicking the link, current members can invite you (ask the second year fellows).

## Making the most out of Northwestern
Here is a list of some of the great resources the university has to offer: 
- [Norris University Center](https://goo.gl/maps/nYyhhkTArYMoHUZ69):
    - [Norris Mini Courses](https://www.northwestern.edu/norris/arts-recreation/mini-courses/index.html) are recreational classes for adults four times a year, beginning in October, January, April, and July. 
    - [Norris Outdoors](https://www.northwestern.edu/norris/arts-recreation/norris-outdoors/index.html) rents out camping gear, ice skates, cross-country skis and snowshoes.
    - You can get your official Northwestern gear at the [bookstore](https://goo.gl/maps/dUePtEj8kAXYpe5L6).
- [Henry Crown Sports Pavilion](https://goo.gl/maps/hnHPGgaC19kkGLPDA):
    -  Membership is not included as part of the fellows program. You can purchase an annual membership for $400 and a $100 one-time registration fee. You can complete a membership request [online](https://nurecreation.com/sports/2015/8/12/employeemembership.aspx?path=membership), but it’s easiest to purchase it in-person at the membership office from 9-4. The membership office is left of the entrance service desk at the Henry Crowne Pavilion.
    -  There are year-round [adult swim lessons](https://nurecreation.com/sports/2015/8/12/adultswimlessons.aspx)(both group and private lessons) and [scuba diving classes](https://nurecreation.com/sports/2015/8/12/scubadivingclasses.aspx).
    -  The [Wellness Suite](https://nurecreation.com/facilities/wellness-suite/12) has free white-light therapy, which is quite useful in winter when there is limited sunlight. You can also schedule massages there.
- The [Northwestern Sailing Center](https://northwesternsailing.com/) has sailing, windsurfing, stand up paddle, rentals and classes.
- The [Bienen School of Music](https://www.music.northwestern.edu/events) has year-round concerts.
- The [Block Museum of Art](https://www.blockmuseum.northwestern.edu/) will be reopening on September 22, 2022.
- The [Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts](https://wirtz.northwestern.edu/) has productions in theatre, music theatre, and dance.
- The [Segal Visitors Center](https://goo.gl/maps/KLqeC3irsnVHe8aR8) offers discounted U-locks to wildcard holders.
- You can also access all of [Northwestern's libraries](https://www.library.northwestern.edu/) with your wildcard.

A useful tool to find out about activities and resources available to you is the [Paw Print newsletter](https://www.northwestern.edu/studentaffairs/community/students/sa-student-update-archive.html). The newsletter is sent out to registered undergraduates or members of the School of Professional Studies and contains news and activities relevant for Northwestern students. You can try being added to the list by emailing [Jill Norton](mailto:jill-norton@northwestern.edu).

## Taking part in classes and seminars
### Classes
There are two ways you can take a class at Northwestern:
1. You can **audit** a class by emailing a professor before the start of the quarter, and defining what the requirements will be. Most professors require you to do all the readings, some do not want you handing in assignments since this implies a larger workload for them or their TAs. You can only audit MBA and PhD courses. Here is a list of all available courses:
    1. [Kellogg MBA courses](https://www6.kellogg.northwestern.edu/CourseCatalog)
    2. [Kellogg PhD courses](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/doctoral/academicexperience/phd-courses.aspx)
    3. [Department of Economics PhD courses](https://economics.northwestern.edu/graduate/courses/index.html)
2. You can **enroll** in [undergraduate-level courses](https://catalogs.northwestern.edu/undergraduate/courses-az/)

#### Enrolling in undergraduate-level courses
To enroll in an undergraduate-level course, you first have to apply to the School of Professional Studies to register as a [Non-Degree Special Student](https://sps.northwestern.edu/non-degree-special-student/ndss-US.php). International students should also follow the US student application requirements. The application requirements include the application form, a brief statement of purpose, and official transcripts. Part-time tuition is $7,394 for enrollment in 1 or 2 courses (for the 2022-2023 academic year). Here are the current application deadlines:

Quarter | Application deadline
--- | --- 
Fall (classes begin Tuesday, September 20, 2022) | August 12, 2022
Winter (classes begin Tuesday, January 3, 2023) | November 11, 2022 
Spring (classes begin Tuesday, March 28, 2023) | February 10, 2023


#### Applying for tuition benefits
You can apply for tuition benefits from your first day at Northwestern. [Employee Reduced Tuition benefits](https://www.northwestern.edu/hr/benefits/tuition/employee/reduced-tuition-benefits.html) cover 90% of tuition for courses taken at Northwestern. With tuition benefits, you would only have to pay 10% of the $7,394 part-time tuition for one or two courses.

To apply for tuition benefits, create a new application by logging into [myHR](https://myhr.northwestern.edu/) with your NetID. Select **Benetifts** -> **My Tuition Benefit Application** -> **Submit New Application**. Since this takes between 4 to 6 weeks to process, try to apply for tuition benefits *before* applying to enroll as a Non-Degree Special Student.

### Seminars
There are several seminars and lunches you can sign up to attend. You can look for your fields of interest in the following lists:
1. [Seminars organized by the Department of Economics](https://economics.northwestern.edu/events/seminars/index.html)
2. [Faculty and research events at Kellogg](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/events.aspx)
3. [Global Poverty Research Lab events](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/global-poverty-research-lab/events.aspx)

You can attend all seminars without signing up, but you must sign up to be on the email list and get lunch. Here is a list of who you have to email to sign up for a few of the seminars:
- HELP (Health, education, labor, and public economics): [Lola May Ittner](mailto:lola.ittner@NORTHWESTERN.EDU)
- Development: [Kayla Marie Atkins](mailto:kayla.carbone@NORTHWESTERN.EDU)
- Economic history: [Lola May Ittner](mailto:lola.ittner@NORTHWESTERN.EDU)
- Political economy: [Carly Loonan](mailto:carly.loonan@kellogg.northwestern.edu)
