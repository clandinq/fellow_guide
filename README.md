There are several seminars and lunches you can sign up to attend. You can look for your fields of interest in the following lists (which overlap):
1.  Seminars organized by the Department of Economics: https://economics.northwestern.edu/events/seminars/index.html
2.  Faculty and research events at Kellogg: https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/events.aspx
3.  Global Poverty Research Lab events: https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/global-poverty-research-lab/events.aspx
